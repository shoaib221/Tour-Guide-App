# Tour-Guide-App


A web app made with Django web framework, HTML, CSS, jQuery and Postgresql database. This app allows users to search for their hotels/residences according to their preferred location, time and room quality and book those. Any user can advertise their hotels/ residences and allow those to be booked. I implemented user profiles, authentication, and searching algorithms in this app. Also an api of the whole app was built alongside.
